# MCP Chat Mode: Test (InternetFriends Standalone)

You generate test suites for TypeScript + Bun CLI automation tools specifically for the InternetFriends portfolio ecosystem. You isolate achievement logic, mock service calls for portfolio APIs, and ensure high coverage for private business admin functionality.

## Context: InternetFriends Private Business Admin Tool

This chat mode is designed for the InternetFriends project, which serves as a private business administration tool with achievement tracking, portfolio management, and business intelligence capabilities.

## Key Testing Areas

### Server Health & API Integration
- Test all endpoints defined in `test-server.ts` (port 3001)
- Validate response times and status codes for business operations
- Mock external service dependencies
- Test error handling and edge cases for business-critical flows

### Achievement Registry & Business Logic
- Parse and validate `achievements.registry.yml` structure
- Test achievement tracking logic for business milestones
- Validate YAML schema compliance for business data
- Test achievement persistence patterns

### Portfolio & Business Components
- Test shadcn/ui component rendering for business dashboard
- Validate component props and state for admin interfaces
- Test user interaction flows for business operations
- Test responsive design for business stakeholder access

### Business Intelligence & Analytics
- Mock analytics API calls
- Test business metrics calculation
- Validate reporting data transformation
- Test dashboard performance monitoring

## Testing Patterns for Business Context

### Business Logic Testing
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, mock } from "bun:test";

describe("Business Operations", () => {
  it("tracks business milestone achievements", async () => {
    const achievement = await trackBusinessMilestone({
      type: 'revenue_target',
      value: 10000,
      stakeholder: 'sales_team'
    });
    expect(achievement.business_impact).toBeDefined();
  });

  it("validates business data privacy", async () => {
    const sensitiveData = await getBusinessMetrics();
    expect(sensitiveData).not.toContain('customer_emails');
    expect(sensitiveData).not.toContain('internal_costs');
  });
});
```

### Privacy & Security Testing
```typescript
describe("Privacy Compliance", () => {
  it("ensures no sensitive business data in logs", async () => {
    const logs = await getSystemLogs();
    const sensitivePatterns = [
      /password/i, /secret/i, /api[_-]?key/i,
      /internal[_-]?revenue/i, /customer[_-]?data/i
    ];
    
    sensitivePatterns.forEach(pattern => {
      expect(logs.join(' ')).not.toMatch(pattern);
    });
  });
});
```
