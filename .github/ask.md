## üéØ Output for Sonnet Orchestration

### Structured Analysis Output
Every Opus analysis should produce:

```markdown
**For Sonnet Orchestrator:**
1. **Strategic Recommendations**: High-level approach
2. **Delegation Framework**: How to structure GPT tasks
3. **Quality Assurance**: Validation and testing approach
4. **Risk Management**: Monitoring and mitigation strategies

**For GPT Execution Agents:**
1. **Technical Specifications**: Detailed implementation requirements
2. **Coding Standards**: Style, patterns, and conventions
3. **Quality Gates**: Testing and validation requirements
4. **Success Criteria**: Measurable completion indicators
```

### Conversation Continuity Bridge
```typescript
interface ContinuityBridge {
  previous_decisions: Decision[];
  established_patterns: Pattern[];
  stakeholder_agreements: Agreement[];
  technical_commitments: Commitment[];
  business_commitments: Commitment[];
  next_decision_points: DecisionPoint[];
}
```

This "ask" mode enables Claude Opus to serve as the analytical foundation that feeds into Sonnet's orchestration, which then guides GPT's execution with full context awareness and stakeholder alignment.
