```bash
# Solution: Restart Zed editor and ensure .zed/tasks.json exists
# Re-open project folder in Zed
```

**Issue**: GitHub Actions not running
```bash
# Solution: Check repository settings
# Ensure Actions are enabled in repository settings
# Verify branch protection rules if applicable
```

**Issue**: Quality scripts showing errors
```bash
