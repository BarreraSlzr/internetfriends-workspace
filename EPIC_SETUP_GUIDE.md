---

## 📋 Complete Setup Process

### Prerequisites

✅ **Git Repository**: Project must be a git repository
✅ **Bun Runtime**: Bun must be installed (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
✅ **Main Branch**: Repository should have a `main` branch as default
✅ **Clean Working Directory**: Commit any uncommitted changes before starting

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Verify Environment
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Check if on main branch
git branch --show-current

# Check bun installation
bun --version

# Check project structure
ls -la scripts/epic-tools/
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Global Epic Command (Optional)

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
echo 'alias epic="./scripts/epic-tools/epic"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Or create a symlink in your PATH
ln -s "$(pwd)/scripts/epic-tools/epic" /usr/local/bin/epic-if
```

#### Step 3: Configure Git for Epic Strategy

```bash
# Ensure git config is set
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Optional: Set up better git log alias
git config --global alias.epic-log "log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%C(reset) %C(blue)%an%C(reset) %C(green)%ar%C(reset) %s %C(red)%d%C(reset)' --all"
```

## 📚 Best Practices

### Epic Naming

✅ **Good Epic Names:**
- `database-manager-v1` - Version specific
- `ai-agent-integration` - Clear purpose
- `performance-optimization-q1` - Time-bound
- `security-hardening-2024` - Year specific

❌ **Avoid:**
- `fixes` - Too vague
- `stuff` - No meaning
- `john-work` - Person-specific
- `temp-branch` - Not epic-worthy

### Epic Scope

**🎯 Right-sized Epics (2-4 weeks):**
- Database connection system
- User authentication overhaul
- Performance optimization sprint
- AI integration milestone

**🚫 Too Large (>6 weeks):**
- Complete application rewrite
- Entire new product feature
- Full infrastructure migration

**🚫 Too Small (<1 week):**
- Single bug fix
- Minor UI adjustment
- Configuration change

### Feature Organization

```bash
# Group related features in epics
epic/user-management-v2/
├── feat/authentication-system
├── feat/profile-management
├── feat/permission-system
└── feat/user-dashboard

# Keep features focused and atomic
feat/add-password-reset      # ✅ Specific
feat/user-stuff             # ❌ Too vague
feat/complete-auth-rewrite  # ❌ Too large
```

## 🎭 Epic Philosophy

> **"Every epic tells a story. Every merge tells a chapter. Every release tells the complete book of your project's journey."**

### The Epic Mindset

1. **Think in Stories**: Each epic should solve a complete user problem
2. **Visual Timeline**: Git graph becomes a visual project timeline
3. **Measurable Impact**: Every epic should deliver quantifiable value
4. **Clean History**: Future developers should understand the journey
5. **Milestone Thinking**: Epics represent meaningful project milestones

---

## 🔄 Migration from Traditional Git

### Before Migration
```bash
# Save current work
git add .
git commit -m "save: work before epic migration"
git push origin main
```

### Migration Steps
```bash
# 1. Create first epic from current work
./scripts/epic-tools/epic start migration-to-epics --timeline="1 week"

# 2. Organize existing features into epic structure
./scripts/epic-tools/epic feature add migration-to-epics setup-epic-tools
./scripts/epic-tools/epic feature add migration-to-epics reorganize-branches

# 3. Complete migration epic
./scripts/epic-tools/epic complete migration-to-epics --version="v1.0.0-epic-ready"
```

### Post-Migration
- All future work happens in epic structure
- Old branches can be cleaned up gradually
- Team trains on new epic workflow
- Documentation updated to reflect epic strategy
